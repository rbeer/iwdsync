# Play youtube alongside twitch

Originally made for IWD to make it easier to link to all necessary sources quickly.

# ideas

- show lcs/lec twitch chat in transparent window over video?
    - toggle on off
    - options for showing different chats
- easier way to set youtube url
- twitch chat on right?
- caster stream on left?
- youtube muted by default
- twitch sound on by default
