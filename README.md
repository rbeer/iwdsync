# Play youtube alongside twitch

Originally made for IWD to make it easier to link to all necessary sources quickly.

# ideas

- easier way to set youtube url
- youtube muted by default
- twitch sound on by default
- sync youtube with IWD using carbo's method
    - switch to using the controlled player api's
    - save timestamps to hardstuck OR use some online key/value store
    - save youtube video to hardstuck?
