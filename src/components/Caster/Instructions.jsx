                <li>
                    You can show/hide twitch chat, move the mini player, separate out the twitch
                    stream.

            <h3>How to sync video</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Change the <b>offset</b> value below the youtube stream until the{' '}
                    <b>game timer</b> matches with the timer in the twitch stream.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Your offset value will save for the next time you use the same browser, but if
                    the twitch delay changes you may have re-set it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can click on the offset input field and use your up and down arrow keys to
                    nudge the time by 0.1 seconds.
                </li>
            </ul>

                    If your video is not syncing and you are watching a live youtube stream, you may
                    need to first play the youtube stream at 2x speed to ensure you are ahead of the
                    caster.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If it still isn't working, click the lock in the address bar and try deleting
                    the site cookies and retrying.
